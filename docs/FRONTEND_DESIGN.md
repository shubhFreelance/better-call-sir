# Frontend design direction

Owner direction, 12 October 2026: use shadcn/ui, the installed [frontend-design skill](../.agents/skills/frontend-design/SKILL.md), and the Wispr Flow palette supplied by the owner. The environment proxy denies both `wisprflow.ai` and its `www` address; no full-site inspection is claimed. The owner's supplied colors are authoritative for this implementation.

## Tokens and layout

| Token | Hex | Role |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Deep teal | `#034F46` | Primary actions, focus and brand accents |
| Lavender | `#F0D7FF` | Selected discovery tab and assistance highlights |
| Cream | `#FFFFEB` | Main canvas |
| White | `#FFFFFF` | Forms and content surfaces |
| Charcoal | `#17201F` | Primary text |
| Muted gray | `#586562` | Helper text |

Use self-hosted Manrope Variable for English interface text and headings; browser sans-serif fallback covers characters outside that font. Full Hindi typography/localization remains a separate acceptance item. Teal is paired with white on primary controls; lavender carries dark text rather than white text. Borders and disabled states are derived neutral colors; error red is reserved for errors.

Teacher discovery uses two equally visible tabs above the page content. Manual search has a full-width text field, visibly labelled criteria in a four-column desktop/two-column mobile grid, then teacher cards. Assisted discovery explains what information is needed and leads into guardian criteria intake. A chosen teacher remains identified through sign-in and submission.

```text

[ Search a teacher or subject                      ]
[ Subject ][ Format ][ Board ][ Class              ]
[ Language ][ Locality ][ Budget ][ Reset          ]
Results and teacher profiles
```

Forms use left-aligned labels, useful helper text, consistent action names, explicit required/optional fields, field-level errors and recoverable server failures. A multi-step form must preserve input when moving back or retrying. Empty states offer a next action; success is shown only after an API-confirmed result. Student browsing and guardian-only submission remain distinct account permissions.

## Component foundation

Official shadcn New York v4 Button, Input, Tabs, Alert and Textarea source is vendored from `shadcn-ui/ui` commit `993eb2c3151997ce08a49635c10fd8c8ef3713c7`. Imports are adapted to the project's utility and individual Radix packages; the upstream MIT notice is retained alongside the components. The public shadcn registry is also blocked by the environment proxy, so installation uses its official GitHub source. Tailwind v4 utilities are enabled without its reset to preserve existing screens while they are migrated. Existing custom form/buttons outside the shared helpers still require migration.

shadcn/ui supplies the component primitives, not a mandatory font or brand palette. Charts will use its chart components with actual reporting data when dashboards are implemented; no invented operational metrics are added for appearance.

## Frontend sprint order

1. Design foundation and manual/assisted discovery, including real API submission and keyboard/mobile checks.
2. Email OTP sign-in and guardian onboarding: draft resume, structured schedule entry, clear consent and confirmation.
3. Teacher onboarding: profile, private evidence uploads, review status, availability and leave.
4. Guardian and student dashboards: invitation/device access, recommendations, demo/terms, recurring lessons and attendance.
5. Revision checkout and private meeting access, with honest payment and meeting states.
6. Learning notes, support/rematch/privacy flows and role-scoped operator dashboards/reports.

Review desktop and 360px screenshots, keyboard navigation, contrast, loading/error/empty states, and real/mock API behavior for each completed feature. Feature commits are pushed separately. Production/provider qualification and deferred backend stories remain open.
